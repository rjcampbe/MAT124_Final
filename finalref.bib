abstract = {USA300 is a hypervirulent, community-acquired, multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone that started to spread in the United States around 17 years ago. Many studies detected it also in South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. In this study, we show that USA300 is also circulating in sub-Saharan Africa. Locating the temporal and spatial origin of clonal lineages is important with respect to epidemiology and molecular evolution of pathogens. We show that USA300 evolved from a less virulent and less resistant ancestor circulating in Central Europe around 160 years ago. Constant surveillance of pathogen transmission routes is vital to prevent and control potential outbreaks. Whole genome sequencing proved to be a useful tool for epidemiological surveillance. USA300 is a pandemic clonal lineage of hypervirulent, community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) with specific molecular characteristics. Despite its high clinical relevance, the evolutionary origin of USA300 remained unclear. We used comparative genomics of 224 temporal and spatial diverse S. aureus isolates of multilocus sequence type (ST) 8 to reconstruct the molecular evolution and global dissemination of ST8, including USA300. Analyses of core SNP diversity and accessory genome variations showed that the ancestor of all ST8 S. aureus most likely emerged in Central Europe in the mid-19th century. From here, ST8 was exported to North America in the early 20th century and progressively acquired the USA300 characteristics Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), SCCmec IVa, the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), and a specific mutation in capsular polysaccharide gene cap5E. Although the PVL-encoding phage ??Sa2USA was introduced into the ST8 background only once, various SCCmec types were introduced to ST8 at different times and places. Starting from North America, USA300 spread globally, including Africa. African USA300 isolates have aberrant spa-types (t112, t121) and form a monophyletic group within the clade of North American USA300. Large parts of ST8 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolated in Africa represent a symplesiomorphic group of ST8 (i.e., a group representing the characteristics of the ancestor), which are rarely found in other world regions. Isolates previously discussed as USA300 ancestors, including USA500 and a "historic" CA-MRSA from Western Australia, were shown to be only distantly related to recent USA300 clones.}}

abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R0, is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R0<1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0>1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.}

	abstract = {For decades methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been considered the prototype of multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens, causing infections in high-risk patients. Changes in the healthcare system, coupled with the evolution of this versatile microorganism, have transformed MRSA into a cause of community-onset infections, in both patients who have contact with the healthcare system and patients without such a risk factor. New lineages of MRSA, defined as community acquired (CA)-MRSA, have emerged that have a propensity to cause infections in young individuals without risk factors. CA-MRSA primarily causes skin infections and, rarely, necrotising pneumonia. In the USA, these strains belong to a single widespread clone, designated USA300, while in Europe they belong to a variety of clones. Most strains carry genes for the Panton{\textendash}Valentine leukocidin, whose role in diseases is under debate. In subjects living in the community who have contact with the healthcare system, MRSA strains of the nosocomial type are a frequent cause of infection and of pneumonia in particular. The detection of a large MRSA reservoir in pigs and the finding that professionally exposed individuals are colonised, has further shown that it is necessary to closely follow the epidemiology of MRSA if we want to combat it effectively.

abstract = {Summary
Two mycobacteriophages were administered intravenously to a male with treatment-refractory Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary infection and severe cystic fibrosis lung disease. The phages were engineered to enhance their capacity to lyse M.abscessus and were selected specifically as the most effective against the subject's bacterial isolate. In the setting of compassionate use, the evidence of phage-induced lysis was observed using molecular and metabolic assays combined with clinical assessments. M.abscessus isolates pre and post-phage treatment demonstrated genetic stability, with a general decline in diversity and no increased resistance to phage or antibiotics. The anti-phage neutralizing antibody titers to one phage increased with time but did not prevent clinical improvement throughout the course of treatment. The subject received lung transplantation on day 379, and systematic culturing of the explanted lung did not detect M.abscessus. This study describes the course and associated markers of a successful phage treatment of M.abscessus in advanced lung disease.}
